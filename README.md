Business hours and dissemination
EDGAR accepts new filer applications, new filings, and changes to filer data each business day, Monday through Friday, from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., ET.
 Indexes incorporating the current business day's filings are updated nightly starting about 10:00 p.m., ET; the process is usually completed within a few hours. 
 Some filing submissions that begin after 5:30 p.m. ET—or 10:00 p.m. for Ownership forms 3, 4, 5—will be disseminated the next business day, showing up in the following business day's index.

Some filings are still submitted in paper and are not accessible through EDGAR. PDF scans of some of these filings are accessible through the Virtual Private Reference Room (VPRR), described in more detail below.
